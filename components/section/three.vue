        Since my initial encounter with computers during my early adolescence,
        my fascination with the field has continuously deepened, solidifying my
        belief that it is my life's true passion. As soon as I had the
        opportunity, I embarked on a gradual exploration of both software and
        hardware engineering, eventually discovering my affection for Computer
        Graphics. I'm truly captivated by the allure of this field, which drives
        me to seek a thorough comprehension of its complexities. Along my
        journey, I also ventured into Computer Architecture as well as the other
        various aspects of Hardware and Software Engineering.
