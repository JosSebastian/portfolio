        Since my initial encounter with computers during my early adolescence,
        my fascination with the field has continuously deepened, solidifying my
        belief that it is my life's true passion. As soon as I had the
        opportunity, I embarked on a gradual exploration of both software and
        hardware engineering, eventually discovering my profound affection for
        <span class="font-bold hover:text-blue-100"> Computer Graphics </span>.
        This discipline genuinely captivates me with its unique appeal,
        compelling me to pursue a comprehensive understanding of its
        intricacies. Along my journey, I also ventured into
        <span class="font-bold"> Computer Architecture </span>as well as
        <span class="font-bold"> Hardware and Software Engineering </span>.
      </span>
      <br />

        To expedite my exploration of these interests, I proactively initiated
        several personal projects, each contributing valuable insights to my
        chosen path.
